    Hi, I'm an aspiring Cloud Engineer with a passion for building scalable and efficient systems in the cloud. I'm currently diving deep into version control systems and enhancing my technical skills to create secure, flexible, and collaborative development environments.  

    In addition to my technical pursuits, I'm also working on launching an online Arabic school designed to help students of all levels—beginner, intermediate, and advanced—achieve fluency in speaking Arabic. My goal is to make learning Arabic accessible, engaging, and practical for everyone.  <br><br>

    When I'm not exploring cloud technologies or shaping new educational platforms, I enjoy learning about computer security and graph-based systems, staying updated with the latest tech trends, and finding ways to solve real-world problems using technology. <br> <br>
    Whether you're here to discuss cloud engineering, language learning, or creative tech solutions, I'm always excited to connect and collaborate!
